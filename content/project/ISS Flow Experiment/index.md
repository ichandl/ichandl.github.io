Part of my work over summer 2023 involved laying the mechatronics foundations for a fluid flow experiment in microgravity. I assisted in integrating high-speed cameras, motors, and a microcontroller into a low-profile, fully autonomous payload. Most of the work has been handed off to other lab members.

More to come?!?
