My primary research project over this past year (2023), including this summer, has been on an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) that utilizes bio-inspired propulsion to achieve high-efficiency forward thrust. I have been primarily involved with the small-scale test vehicle, where I have designed mechanical hardware and the controls system. The small-scale demonstrator was used to secure funding for the full-scale design and will used as a test-bed for control schema and system dynamics.

The design incorporates multiple features derived from recent bio-inspired propulsion studies. Specifically, the vehicle is designed to (1) minimize peak and nominal cost of transport/propulsive efficiency/swimming economy; (2) maximize range/endurance; (3) maximize top speed; (4) be capable of aggressive maneuvers while moving and motionless; and (5) minimize acoustic signature. These goals will be achieved by designing and implementing major components that include the propulsor, fuselage, and control mechanisms.
