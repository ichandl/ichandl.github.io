In the spring of my freshman year, I participated in the annual Rock-On Workshop as a member of the University of Delaware team. Over three months, our team of three assembled a sounding rocket payload from a kit, using a pre-recorded guide series. Culminating in a successful launch and collection of data at Wallops Flight Facility in VA, I was able to experience the full life-cycle of a space-bound science mission as a freshman undergraduate.

The annual workshop is hosted by the Colorado Space Grant Consortium and is organized by Professor Christopher Koehler at the University of Colorado Boulder. The University of Delaware team was facilitated by Professor Bennett Maruca and financially supported by the Delaware Space Grant Consortium.

Many thanks to those listed above. This project opened so many doors for me and ignited the passion that I still have for spaceflight and instrumentation. I don't know where I would be without this project; it was truly a blessing.
