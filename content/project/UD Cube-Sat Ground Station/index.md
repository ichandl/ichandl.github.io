From summer 2022 to spring 2023, I worked on the University of Delaware's Cube-Sat Ground Station (CSGS) at Mt. Cuba Astronomical Observatory. I was primarily involved with the client-side command and control interface. I designed a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) that interfaced with the CSGS TCP network. The GUI has a live video feed, manual and automatic control functions, autonomous sattalite pass tracking, data livestreaming, and a queue functionality for multiple clients. The GUI interfaced with control code on the CSGS that handelled the mechanical movement and radio functionality in the programable logic controller. All work has now been handed off to the Delaware Space Observation Center for use on the CSGS.

Great thanks to Professor Maruca and Jarod Dagney for the mentorship, and the Delaware Space Grant Consortium for the summer research stipend.
